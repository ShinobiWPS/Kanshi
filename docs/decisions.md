# Why i made these choices

## **Render pattern**
>
> **CSR** - in the next project i will use SSR, for this dashboard and the size of the team it seems overkill to add such complexity and i want to focus on the rest of aspects first to reduce variance.

## **Framework**
>
> **Remix (React 18)** - just to use all the new feature added and consolidate my knowledge (and reduce variance), I plan on using something else in the future.

## **Runtime**
>
> **Deno 1.37** - ..

## **Package manager**
>
> **deno built-in** - ...

## **State manager**
>
> **..** -

## **API requests**
>
> **..** -

## **CSS**
>
> **..** -

## **Testing**
>
> **Jest** - Deno built-in is not broadly used, i w also wanted to use `Bun` built-in but they are far behind the total coverage of `Jest` compatibility (https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1825) 

## **Deployment**
>
> **..** -
